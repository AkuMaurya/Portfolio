        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            "I am a Computer Engineer (2019-2023) from Mumbai University (Thakur College of Engineering & Technology) with a passion for game development. I have experience in creating 3D games, models and animations in Blender, and I am currently working in Galanto Innovation as a game developer. I am also skilled in using Krita and Photoshop for artwork. I am excited to continue growing my skills and contributing to the game development industry."
            
            I aspire to combine my Blender skills and coding expertise to pursue a career in game development. The art of bringing life into 3D models excites me and pulls me deeper into this field.

            <h3><a href="Galanto.html">Working at Galanto</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> At Galanto Innovation, I developed a range of 3D games focused on motor skill enhancement and rehabilitation. This includes a Scooter Driving Simulation, designed to improve wrist and finger movement, and Pick and Place, which helps with elbow and shoulder coordination. I also worked on Galaxy Warrior, a game that strengthens elbow control through ship navigation, and interactive experiences like Balloon Shooting, Fruit Slash, and Wood Cutting, which enhance reflexes and spatial awareness. Additionally, I created Clean Up, a simulation that encourages movement through virtual cleaning tasks, making therapy engaging and effective. </p>
           
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> C#, Blender, Unity </p>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> I've worked on a range of VR projects using Unity, from a Space Simulation with realistic planetary models to an AI-driven Soil Lab designed for agricultural research. I also created a Real time Chemistry Lab, allowing for safe virtual experiments. My work includes Volumetric Video Capture for lifelike motion, a VR Classroom for remote education, and a Human Anatomy Explorer for medical learning. Additionally, I explored hover-based UI interactions to improve accessibility and user engagement. </p>
