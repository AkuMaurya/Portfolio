        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Gaming is more than a hobby for meâ€”it's a passion that drives my ambition and dedication. As a Computer Engineering student, I began learning Blender just for fun. However, what started as a casual interest quickly turned into a profound enthusiasm for creating 3D models and assets.
        </p>
        <p>
            I aspire to combine my Blender skills and coding expertise to pursue a career in game development. The art of bringing life into 3D models excites me and pulls me deeper into this field.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy creating models and animations in Blender, and artwork with Krita. Currently, I am a graduate Computer Engineer from Thakur College of Engineering and Technology. I am working with the Unity game development engine and Blender3D to continuously upgrade my skills in game development.
